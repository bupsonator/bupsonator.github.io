        <p>
            CSS rules are easy. However they were written in the style= attribute, 
            that's how you do it in pure CSS. Here's an example rule:<br>
            <br>
            selector {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:red;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            Now, just replace h1 with any HTML element, and it will apply to that 
            element. Same goes for the actual properties. Background color, text align, 
            and all of the others that were learned. Maybe one day I'll put 'em here. <br>
            <br>
            TAGS (Least Specific): Selector looks like: h1<br>
            CLASS (Middle specific): Selector looks like: .class OR tag.class<br>
            ID (Most specific): Selector looks like: #ID<br>
            <br>
            The Cascade of CSS introduces a new rule: !important. This rule will override 
            every single selector. Also, if both rules have the same specific-ness, 
            the <b>later</b> rule will be applied. <br>
            <br>
            The cascade's order is Importance > Specificity > Order.<br>
            <br>
            We can use combinators to combine CSS elements.<br>
            A space is a descendant selector, which is everything inside an element.<br>
            &gt; is a child selector, which is everything one level in an element.<br>
            + is a next sibling selector, which will select ONLY the next element in the same parent.<br>
            <br>
            :hover :link :visited and :active are all pseudo-classes. These classes can select an element 
            when it is in a certain state. For example, hover will only apply the style if the element is 
            being hovered over by the cursor. To use them: selector:pseudo-class<br>
            <br>
            Pseudo elements can also be used. These are before, after, first-letter, first-line, and selection. 
            The way you use them is element::pseudo. NOTICE THE TWO COLONS. Before/after use the content: ""; 
            attribute to add content to put before or after an element. First-letter/line will style the first 
            letter or line. Selection will style the content that the user selects.<br>
            <br>
            The visibility attribute can change if an element is visible or not. It will still take up space,
            though. The display attribute can change if an element is shown or not, so it will not take up space
            if it's not, unlike visibility. Opacity works in a similar way, taking a value from 0-1.<br>
            <br>                                                           
        </p>
