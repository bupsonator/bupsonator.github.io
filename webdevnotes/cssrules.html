        <p>
            CSS rules are easy. However they were written in the style= attribute,<br>
            that's how you do it in pure CSS. Here's an example rule:<br>
            <br>
            selector {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:red;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            Now, just replace h1 with any HTML element, and it will apply to that<br>
            element. Same goes for the actual properties. Background color, text align,<br>
            and all of the others that were learned. Maybe one day I'll put 'em here.<br>
            <br>
            TAGS (Least Specific): Selector looks like: h1<br>
            CLASS (Middle specific): Selector looks like: .class OR tag.class<br>
            ID (Most specific): Selector looks like: #ID<br>
            <br>
            The Cascade of CSS introduces a new rule: !important. This rule will override<br>
            every single selector. Also, if both rules have the same specific-ness,<br>
            the <b>later</b> rule will be applied.<br>
            <br>
            The cascade's order is Importance > Specificity > Order.
