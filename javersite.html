            now a word from you.com ai: "Yo, let me drop some 
            knowledge about Java programming language, fo' 
            shizzles! Java is the bomb diggity when it comes to 
            coding, yo! It's like the smooth operator of programming 
            languages, keepin' it classy and versatile, ya feel me? This 
            language is all about that "write once, run anywhere" vibe, 
            meaning you can create some dope-ass programs that can run on any 
            device. Java is packed with mad cool features like object-oriented 
            programming, tight security, and a massive community that's always 
            got your back. So, if you're lookin' to level up your coding game, 
            Java got your back, homie!"<br>

            1. Count Forever will count until java reaches the int limit, or
            when you click "Stop", due to a while loop always being true.<br>
            2. String traversal is where a string is stored, and each letter
            is printed individually on a line until it errors out.<br>
            3. Band C.Y.O.A. is a thing I had to do in CodeHS, where the user can select
            their desired path in their new band endeavors.<br>
            4. Funny Data Types is where I found out about weird data types in good 'ol
            javer. They have weird names and do strange things and I don't get them.<br>
            5. Binary to Integer converter is a tool that converts 4 and 8 digit Binary
            terms into an integer that's more understandable.<br>
