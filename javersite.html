            1. Speedy Count will count until it reaches 1,000,000.<br>
            2. String traversal is where a string is stored, and each letter
            is printed individually on a line.<br>
            3. Band C.Y.O.A. is a thing I had to do in CodeHS, where the user can select
            their desired path in their new band endeavors.<br>
            4. Funny Data Types is where I found out about weird data types in good 'ol
            javer. They have weird names and do strange things and I don't understand.<br>
            5. Binary to Integer converter is a tool that converts 4 and 8 digit Binary
            terms into an integer that's more understandable.<br>
            6. ANSI fancy text sequences shows how I made the colored/bold text happen, and
            how you can in your programs if you wanna figure them out.
