            <p style="text-align:center">This project is solely for entertainment purposes only. It was never intended to be used<br>
            as an alternative to blocked game sites, or as a widespread website at all. The creator<br>
            is not responsible for the actions of other people regarding this project. Again, this is a<br>
            project, not an attempt to take over an institution. The creator does not take ownership of any<br>
            games presented on the website. All games were found on public code sites like Github, and no <br>
            creator credits were removed if they were present in the first place. </p>
