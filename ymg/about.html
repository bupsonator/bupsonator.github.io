            <p>
                made website more efficient, as in you get no benefit, only me :)<br>
                actually, it means ymg doesn't need 100-some html files with the<br>
                exact same code, so it'll run better-ish, and it makes me want to<br>
                add games more, so yay!<br>
                <br>
                i'm aware that fullscreen is suboptimal, but I'm figuring out how<br>
                to make it not that way. enjoy your mom gaming (verb)!
