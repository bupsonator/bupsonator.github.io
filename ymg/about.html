            <p>
                put the per-game headers back.<br>
                <br>
                i have made fullscreen the way it was before again, with the minimize<br>
                button and it not opening a new tab, because i think it's better. i<br>
                did this because of me being able to run my site off of NOT 200 files.<br>
                <br>
                fixed an issue where clicking links would make the website have a<br>
                minor stroke, and clicking empty space would lead to a 404 page.<br>
                <br>
                made website more efficient, as in you get no benefit, only me :)<br>
                actually, it means ymg doesn't need 100-some html files with the<br>
                exact same code, so it'll run better-ish, and it makes me want to<br>
                add games more, so yay!
