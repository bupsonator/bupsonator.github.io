            <h2>about your mom gaming:</h2>
            <p>
                your mom gaming is a dumb flash game website project that i started a few weeks after joining<br>
                a web development class. as i got better at coding, this website improved with my skills. it's<br>
                the biggest web thing i've worked on, and i continue to improve it as i find things to improve.
            </p>
