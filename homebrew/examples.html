        <p>
            So, what can run homebrew? Well, anything can, so long as it has internal storage,
            or an SD card slot! It's just a matter of when. Homebrew is mostly popular with
            game consoles, with the most notable examples being the Wii and 3DS right now, but
            again, anything with internal/external storage can run it. <br>
            <br>
            Here's a few of the most popular ones:

                <td>Nintendo 3DS</td>
                <td>Due to its clamshell design and its compatibility with every
                single Nintendo handheld before it, this is the most worth-it 
                console to hack.</td>

                <td>Sony PlayStation Portable</td>
                <td>These can be purchased for relatively cheap, and are very 
                powerful for their age and their prices. They run PSP, PS1, and 
                many other retro games!</td>

                <td>Nintendo Wii</td>
                <td>This console is one of the most iconic ones, so obviously
                people wanted to do as much as possible with it! It runs Wii,
                GameCube, and below, as well as lots of emulation!</td>
