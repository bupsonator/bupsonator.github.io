        </h2>
        <p>
            Homebrew works in whatever way the developers of it want it to. There's
            not really a baseline of how it works.<br>
            <br>
            However, I can say with confidence that homebrew software works by making
            a device do things it was not intended to do. Here's the steps that 
            homebrew developers usually take to create their software:<br>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="emphasize">Find an exploit.</span> The gateway to homebrew software is an entrypoint
                to run unauthorized software, so finding an exploit is key.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the exploit is found, developers need to make sure they <span class="emphasize">maintain
                their homebrew.</span> Sometimes, a device will lose its homebrew ability when
                it updates, or when it reboots.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, they need to <span class="emphasize">figure out how to code for the device. </span>
                Obviously no software can run on a device if the developer can't develop
                for it.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img class="wrapimage inlineimage" src="/media/bean.png"> Another important thing is that
                they <span class="emphasize">DON'T ENABLE PIRACY.</span> Lots of developers don't do this, or they actively encourage
                it. Piracy is illegal!<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, homebrew software developers just need to <span class="emphasize">know the risks of doing this.</span> The
                original manufacturer of the device may not like knowing that their devide is being used
                for things they didn't want it to be used for (cough, Nintendo).<br><br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So, while homebrew software works in many mysterious ways, the above points are important
            in its creation.
