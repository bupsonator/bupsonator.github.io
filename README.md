This website is the result of a bored high schooler who is sick of game sites being blocked,
and who is in a web development class learning HTML. This site was originally hosted on 
CodeHS, but I got sick of not being able to save due to my "file being to large." So, I decided
to transfer the trash pile onto GitHub!

My user site contains every little project that relates to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because the
whole point of HTML/CSS/JS is to put stuff on the internet, no?

Here's what I've got so far:
- YMG Games:
    YMG stands for Your Mom Games. Yes, that means it would be Your Mom Games Games if you
    un-abbreviated it. This is the website that started my obsession with making websites in
    raw code, and the website that caused me to move from CodeHS to GitHub for my web dev
    endeavors. Read the "About" page on the site to see credits, disclaimer, and what's new!
- Web Dev Notes:
    Me, being in a web development class, thought it'd be super duper funny to put all of my
    notes on a website, and code it in the languages I'm actively learning. That's really it.
- Internet Simulator:
    In my AP Computer Science class that I'm learning Java in, we are in the corner learning at
    our own pace while the teacher teaches Computer Science Principles to everyone else. I
    overheard that they were using an "internet simulator" to simulate the internet for some
    reason, so I used a code AI to create an internet simulator, and then proceeced to make it
    extremely unfunny. 

**AND THERE'S MORE TO COME!**
