# your mom network
picture this: you teach me how to use html, css, javascript, and bootstrap. this entire website
is a result of that.

## here's how the internet is being corrupted by me (a.k.a. my sites):
- your mom gaming: a flash game website, and the one that started it all. it was the first to use
  javascript, and the first one to use bootstrap.
- your mom audio: a soundboard website that serves as an even more distracting sequel to your mom
  gaming.
- ANGER!!!: a website I made when I was extremely pissed one day.
- javerscrips: stuff I do with pure javascript, which gets 'printed' to a 'console' that I also
  made.
- web dev notes: pretty self-explanatory. I take notes using the languages i'm actively learning.
- x: pinetong turtle program that goes brrrrrrr

**and trust me, more is on the way**
