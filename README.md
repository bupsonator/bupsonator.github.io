This website is the result of a bored high schooler who is sick of game sites being blocked,
and who is in a web development class learning HTML. This site was originally hosted on 
CodeHS, but I got sick of not being able to save due to my "file being to large." So, I decided
to transfer the trash pile onto GitHub!

My user site contains every little project that relates to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because the
whole point of HTML/CSS/JS is to put stuff on the internet, no?

Here's what I've got so far:
- Your Mom Gaming:
    This is the website that started my obsession with making websites in raw code, and the
    website that caused me to move from CodeHS to GitHub for my web dev endeavors. Read the
    "About" page on the site to see credits, disclaimer, and what's new!
- Your Mom Gaming Retro Edition:
    This is what Your Mom Gaming started out as, and this is now the dumping ground for games
    I decided to get rid of. Very good website.
- Internet Simulator:
    In my AP Computer Science class that I'm learning Java in, we are in the corner learning at
    our own pace while the teacher teaches Computer Science Principles to everyone else. I
    overheard that they were using an "internet simulator" to simulate the internet for some
    reason, so I used a code AI to create an internet simulator, and then proceeced to make it
    extremely unfunny. 
- Web Dev Notes:
    Me, being in a web development class, thought it'd be super duper funny to put all of my
    notes on a website, and code it in the languages I'm actively learning. That's really it.
- Homebrew Info:
    This is a CodeHS project that I decided to publish because I'm proud of the CSS work I did
    with it. It sheds some light on hacking old game console hardware.
- Endangered Animals:
    This is a CodeHS project that I decided to publish because of the amount of work they made
    me put into it. It describes a few endangered animals.
- Javersite:
    This is a website where I embedded my Java project in CodeHS so that you can mess with it.
- Pythings:
    Basically Javersite, but in Pyton instead.
- x:
    X xurtle xrawing xhe x xogo. Xlon Xusk.

**AND THERE'S MORE TO COME!**
