This is what happens when you tell me how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I make extremely
stupid stuff and put it on the Internet. It all started with a game website, and it quickly
expanded into the chaos that this website is today. Enjoy.

Here's what I've got so far:
## Games & Internet Simulator
- Your Mom Gaming:
    This is the website that started my obsession with making websites in raw code, and the
    website that caused me to move from CodeHS to GitHub for my web dev endeavors. Read the
    "About" page on the site to see credits, disclaimer, and what's new!
- Internet Simulator:
    In my AP Computer Science class that I'm learning Java in, we are in the corner learning at
    our own pace while the teacher teaches Computer Science Principles to everyone else. I
    overheard that they were using an "internet simulator" to simulate the internet for some
    reason, so I used a code AI to create an internet simulator, and then proceeced to make it
    extremely unfunny. 

## Educational Sites
- Web Dev Notes:
    Me, being in a web development class, thought it'd be super duper funny to put all of my
    notes on a website, and code it in the languages I'm actively learning. That's really it.
- Homebrew Info:
    This is a CodeHS project that I decided to publish because I'm proud of the CSS work I did
    with it. It sheds some light on hacking old game console hardware.
- Endangered Animals:
    This is a CodeHS project that I decided to publish because of the amount of work they made
    me put into it. It describes a few endangered animals.
- Aesop's Fables:
    It has nothing to do with Aesop, or fables. It's just me learning CSS interaction and
    animation stuff.

## Javer, Pyton & Other Funnies
- Javersite:
    This is a website where I embedded my Java project in CodeHS so that you can mess with it.
- Pythings:
    Basically Javersite, but in Pyton instead.
- Blinkers:
    It's a thing where I coded Karel to be blinkers infinitely in Java, so I recorded a video
    of it and it's on the internet now.
- Bird Blog Website:
    A CodeHS thing I had to make. It's not a copy of another popular bird-related social platform.
    It's definitely not in response to Elongated Muskrat ruining Twitter. Never.

**AND THERE'S MORE TO COME!**
