This is what happens when you tell me how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I make extremely
stupid stuff and put it on the Internet. It all started with a game website, and it quickly
expanded into the chaos that this website is today. Enjoy.

## Here's what I've got so far:
- aesop's fables: This website was a CodeHS thing. It's funny when the books become big, that's
  why it's here.
- ANGER!!!!!!: This website is the result of some 'great' headspace at the time. It has fire!
- bird blog website: This one is another project I had to do. It was my final HTML/CSS-only website,
  and it's inspired by the former social media website, Twitter.
- blinkers: It's Karel blinkers that were made in Java SuperKarel, which I recorded and put on a
  very basic website.
- endangered animals: This was a CodeHS project. It has a few animals with funny names that are
  either endangered or threatened.
- homebrew info: This is another CSS project I had to do. It has various HTML elements and has
  some simple facts about the game console homebrew scene.
- interactions: This was the first big web project I wanted to start after my biggest project,
  your mom gaming, was starting to finally plateau. It makes you do things, and I use JavaScript
  to make it work.
- internet simulator: This is the third website I've ever made, and I didn't even really make it.
  I used a code AI to make it, and then I styled it and put audio with it.
- javerscrips: First, there was javersite. Then, there was pythings. Both websites contained some
  fun console-only programs I made in Java/Python, respectively. Then, I learned how to make
  JavaScript work with a fake terminal I styled. I now prefer JavaScript over the other two, so I
  translated the Python and Java programs to a JavaScript/HTML DOM thing, leading to javerscrips.
- spooky x3m: It's a really bad website with Moto X3M Spooky Land and bats and spiders. Woo hoo.
- web dev notes: This was the second website I ever made. Me being me, I thought it would be super
  funny to take my notes with the coding languages I was actively learning. It has been improved
  significantly, and it's now kind of just really bad documentation.
- your mom gaming: This was the website that started it all. It all started when I found some very
  simple HTML games on GitHub about 5 years ago, which I still had. I was in a web dev class, so I
  made an index to put them all together. One of my friends saw it and they insisted I put it online
  and give them the link. So I did, and ever since then, I learned more HTML/CSS/JS to make it the
  empire it is today. To see what it looked like when I first made it, I added YMG Retro a long time
  ago. It's the button that says YMG Retro, and you should play it.
- your mom audio: Yet another your mom website, almost a half year after your mom gaming! It's a simple
  soundboard powered by myinstants.com.
- x: It's a Python turtle program that draws the X logo while printing the letter X a random amount of
  times any time the turtle does literally anything.

**AND THERE'S MORE TO COME!**
